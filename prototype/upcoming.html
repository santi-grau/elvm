					<h1>No Such Thing As History: Four Collections and One Artist</h1>
					<p class="article-date">March 20 – August 8, 2014</p>
					<p class="article-description">With artworks from the Christoforakos, Lorenz, Mackert, and Wiese collections, and newly commissioned photographs by Annette Kelm</p>
					<p class="article-curated">Curated by Jens Hoffmann</p>
				</div>
				
				<p>The exhibition No Such Thing As History: Four Collections and one Artist will inaugurate
				the new Espace Louis Vuitton in Munich in the spring of 2014. It will bring together a large
				group of contemporary artworks from four important Munich-based collections with new
				works by the German photographer Annette Kelm, made especially for this exhibition.</p>
				
				<p>No Such Thing As History: Four Collections and one Artist looks at the concept of the
				collection as an archive of art. Like a library, which is an archive of literature, the collection
				is not only an accumulation of artworks but also a locus for the creation of meaning and
				a site for witnessing the developments of art history in the framework of a larger historical
				canon.</p>
				
				<p>Collections create a context in which objects can be interpreted: they are constituted
				by a series of signs that together form a language and narrative. They must frame and
				continue past conversations as well as introduce untested questions. For a work of art to
				enter a collection it must strike a balance between being of permanent significance and</p>
				
				<p>In recent years artists have turned to examining (art) history’s authorship and its meaning
				today’s world while exploring particularly the questions of what is truly knowable which
				ot be experienced first-hand. They have looked at the fact that much of what we think
				now in fact constitutes a record of (art) history that is often a fabrication created to fill
				id of not-knowing. History in many ways is simply fiction.</p>
				
				<p>As a society, and for a number of purposes, both professional and personal, <a href="javascript:void(0)">we fill these
				voids.</a> As artists and curators taking on historical subjects, by revisiting, reconstructing,
				reimagining or even rewriting those subjects we create but also question an identity that
				gives us a sense of self and through that a security we deeply long for as human beings.
				Sometimes the new subject is an altered but earnest reconstruction, built from unverifiable
				raw data, some of which is correct and some of which is not. Sometimes the motivation
				is not a reconstruction at all but rather a new subject entirely, one that acknowledges
				and leverages the not-knowing in ways that give birth to a new presentness one whose
				signifying function is occluded by strong alterations. If there is a truth it is that history is
				mostly speculation, a fake with no original. To quote <a href="javascript:void(0)">Jens Hoffmann</a>:</p>

				<p>The four collections—Christoforakos, Lorenz, Mackert, and Wiese—offer an introduction
				to the world of today’s contemporary art containing a large variety of works of some of
				the most influential artists of our time including many of those who have investigated and
				questioned the traditional understanding of history.</p>
				
				<p>The result is an exhibition that brings together approximately 30 works from the four
				collections, including photography, sculpture, painting, and 10 new photographs by Kelm.
				They will all be presented as one installation, placed alongside each other.</p>

				<h2>About Annette Kelm</h2>
				
				<p>Annette Kelm was born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1975, and now lives in Berlin. She works
				exclusively in the medium of photography, and her work references historically significant
				events or sites. She follows seemingly traditional genres such as the portrait, still life,
				architecture, and landscape. She usually uses an analog medium- or large-format camera
				and makes all her prints personally. Her work has been shown in museums around the
				world, including at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2013), Presentation House
				Gallery, Vancouver (2012), Bonner Kunstverein, Bonn, Germany (2011), Kunst-Werke</p>
